# CRUD application

CRUD stands for the following operations:

- C = **C**reate
- R = **R**ead
- U = **U**pdate
- D = **D**elete

To test this application, you need to do the following steps:

1. Create a database named **crud**
2. Modify database configurations in the **config/config.php**
3. Run **install.php**. This creates the table/s in the database. 
4. Now you can test the crud operations.
